Wireless Voltmeter Project

The task of this project was to incorporate skills I have learned in wireless communications and skills in using the PIC Microcontroller.

Here I decided to use an already provided Transmitter and Reciever to interface with a Microcontroller and one Analog to Digital Converter to read the Voltage (Provided from an analog PSU) and be sent wirelessly for output on a LCD Screen.

This Project involves two differnt code bases for two differnt PIC Microcontrollers using some libraries provided by my instructor with some small adjustments to meet my needs.

The result was a working Voltmeter to two Decimal places that worked flawlessly while wired together, but encountered some noise while being operated wirelessly. As it was a communications lab, some environmental noise was possible, and the provided Transmitters and Recievers were not optimal for precise communications.
